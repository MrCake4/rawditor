# rawditor
A little side-project of mine. The rawditor is a JavaScript photo-editor.

# Key Features
- Essential photo editing tools (brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, etc.)
- Experimental effects like pixel sorting and glitch-style filters
- Real-time previews with adjustable sliders

# How to use
Editor does not work properly if you open the index.html in a browser due to CORS restrictions. To run it properly, launch it with a local server (e.g. the Live Server plugin in VS Code).
